Hi! 

My name is Danuja Jayasuriya and I am a 21 year old software engineering undergraduate. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and create meaningful experiences for people.

I am excited to share with you my portfolio, which I created using React.js and Tailwind CSS. React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy and customizable styling.

My portfolio showcases some of the projects I have worked on and the skills I have acquired. It includes information about my education, work experience, and personal projects.
